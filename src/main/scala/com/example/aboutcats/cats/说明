That's a lot of information, but the important thing is that an implicit scope consists only of
companion objects, and that Category 2 is implicit members of those companion objects.
Note that both the type constructor's companion object and the type parameters' companion object
are included into implicit scope.

****
trait or class 可能之间存在继承关系 但是他们对应的companion object不存在对应的关系
